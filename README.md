# Anime-Dimensions-Simulator
Obfuscated until the game patches it lol

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGetAsync'https://yieldingexploiter.github.io/Anime-Dimensions-Simulator/init.lua','GameScript')();
```

## Compatability
This works on **any** executor that has a [![UNC](https://yieldingexploiter.github.io/Anime-Dimensions-Simulator/badge16.png)](https://scriptunc.org) [Console](https://github.com/unified-naming-convention/NamingStandard/tree/main/api/console) imlpementation, and can run obfuscated scripts at a decent speed, will be able to run this script.

## How to use it

### Executing
1. Copy & Paste the above loadstring into your executor
2. Open the game
3. Click Play, then join around
4. Run the script
5. Done!

P.S. If you run it outside of a round, you will run into [this](https://github.com/YieldingExploiter/Anime-Dimensions-Simulator/issues/1) error.<br/>
For some executors, it will just run when you join; for others, you'll need to re-run when you join the main place.

### Starting the farming
Type `start` in the console, then press enter.
